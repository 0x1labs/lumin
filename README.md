# Lumin

Lumin is a native macOS app that keeps you fresh while you work. It schedules eye breaks, water reminders, and custom pauses, then presents them in lightweight SwiftUI overlays that stay out of the way until you need them.

## Highlights

- **Smart break scheduling** – Regular, micro, water, and custom breaks managed by a single timeline-aware controller.
- **One-click pause/resume** – Toggle all timers from the dashboard; the next/upcoming sections stay in sync when you resume.
- **Keyboard-friendly overlays** – Skip with `Esc` or `Space` (no mouse required) and the previously focused app regains focus automatically.
- **Multi-display support** – Break overlays cover every connected monitor, so reminders are impossible to miss.
- **Statistics at a glance** – Daily totals, completion rates, and break distribution with a reset button when you want a fresh start.
- **Personalized styling** – Pick from new gradient themes (Aurora, Lava, Forest, Midnight, Rose, Galaxy, and more) and tweak overlay opacity without leaving the app.
